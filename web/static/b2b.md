B2B (Business To Business)
---------------------------

On the Internet, B2B (business-to-business), also known as e-biz, is the exchange of products, services or information (aka e-commerce) between businesses, rather than between businesses and consumers.
The overall volume of B2B (Business-to-Business) transactions is much higher than the volume of B2C transactions.
The primary reason for this is that in a typical supply chain there will be many B2B transactions involving sub components or raw materials, and only one B2C transaction, specifically sale of the finished product to the end customer.

B2B have a great focus on large data exchange, such that the efficient of the business can improve. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is mainly used in this field.
