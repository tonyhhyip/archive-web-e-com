B2C (Business To Customer)
---------------------------

"Business-to-Consumer," usually abbreviated B2C, is a phrase that has become attached to electronic business activities that focus on retail transactions rather than activities conducted between two businesses. Most companies that sell directly to consumers can be referred to as B2C companies.

One of the earliest B2C company is Amazon. Amazon.com started as an online bookstore, but soon diversified, selling DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, video downloads / streaming, MP3 downloads / streaming, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys and jewelry.

In the later session of the website, we will talk about how to start up a web shop providing B2C service.
